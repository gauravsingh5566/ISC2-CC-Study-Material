# Risk Management

## Understanding Risks

Risks within an organization can broadly be categorized into two types: Internal Risks, which originate from within the organization, and External Risks, which stem from factors outside the organization's control. Additionally, there are Multiparty Risks that affect more than one organization, as well as risks specific to knowledge-based organizations such as Intellectual Property Theft and Software License Compliance issues.

## Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is the process of identifying and evaluating potential risks. It involves analyzing Threats, which are external forces that pose security risks, and Vulnerabilities, which are weaknesses in the organization's security controls. Risks, therefore, arise from the combination of a Threat and a Vulnerability. Risks are typically assessed based on their Likelihood, the probability of occurrence, and their Impact, the potential damage they may cause.

There are two primary techniques for assessing risks:

1. **Qualitative Risk Assessment**: This method utilizes subjective ratings to evaluate the likelihood and impact of risks. It often involves qualitative descriptions or ranking scales to assess risks.

2. **Quantitative Risk Assessment**: In contrast, quantitative risk assessment employs objective numeric ratings to evaluate the likelihood and impact of risks. It involves mathematical models and statistical analysis to quantify risks more precisely.

## Risk Treatment

Risk treatment involves analyzing and implementing responses to manage and control identified risks. There are four main options for treating risks:

1. **Risk Avoidance**: This strategy involves altering business practices to make certain risks irrelevant, effectively eliminating them from consideration.
   
2. **Risk Transference**: Risk transference involves shifting the financial burden of a risk to another party, such as through insurance or contractual agreements.

3. **Risk Mitigation**: Risk mitigation aims to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk through various measures, such as implementing security controls or enhancing protective measures.

4. **Risk Acceptance**: Sometimes, organizations choose to accept certain risks, acknowledging them as part of doing business while implementing measures to monitor and manage them effectively.

## Selecting Security Controls

Security controls play a crucial role in reducing the likelihood or impact of risks. They can be categorized based on their purpose and mechanism:

1. **Control Purpose**: Controls can be preventive, detective, or corrective, depending on whether they aim to prevent security issues, identify them, or address them after they occur.

2. **Control Mechanism**: Controls can be technical, administrative, or physical, utilizing technology, processes, or physical measures, respectively, to achieve control objectives.

## Configuration Management

Configuration management involves tracking and maintaining specific device settings to ensure a stable operating environment. It includes activities such as establishing baselines, versioning configurations, and standardizing device settings through naming conventions and IP addressing schemes. Change management processes help implement and track changes to configurations, ensuring consistency and stability.
